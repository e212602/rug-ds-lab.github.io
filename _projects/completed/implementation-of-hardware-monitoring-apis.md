In this project we are developing a resource manager framework, part of this framework is to design monitoring APIs functionalities, which gathers hardware metrics upon invocation. You will be given a code template and your task is to fill in the code for some API functionalities. Supplementary programs and helper functions will be provided to be able to test your implementation. A documentation for the required API functions including their input and output parameters will be provided. This project requires C and Python programming as well as basic operating systems knowledge.
