  supervisors: ["Huy Truong", "Dilek Düştegör"]
  available: true
  date: 2025-01-21
  type: ["bachelor"]
  description: |
    Researchers studying drinking water distribution networks often rely on large-scale synthesized datasets. However, the current simulation generating these datasets faces limitations in retrieving metadata that enhances dataset accessibility. Moreover, this missing metadata, including customer profiles at each node in the network, plays a crucial role in classifying customer types and estimating their demand, particularly during peak seasons. To address this gap, the student could apply unsupervised clustering algorithms such as K-NN, K-means, or DBSCAN to identify and retrieve these customer profiles. This project requires a candidate with a solid background in Machine Learning and interest in building robust data pipelines. They will be eventually employed to extract the missing metadata for a large-scale dataset, enabling water experts to analyze water network and benchmark customer behavior efficiently.<br />

  description: |
    Working with data in the real world often leads to missing information problems, which can negatively affect the performance of deep learning models. However, in proper ways, it can boost the expressiveness of Graph Neural Network (GNN) models in node representation learning through a technique known as Node Masking. In particular, it hides arbitrary nodal features in a graph and instructs the GNN to recover the missing parts. The student can explore diverse masking strategies, such as zero masking, random node replacement, mean-neighbor substitution, shared learnable embedding, and nodal permutation. These options above should be compared and evaluated in a graph reconstruction task that applies to a water distribution network. This study will focus on finding a generative technique that effectively enhances the performance of GNN models in semi-supervised transductive learning. Students interested in joining this project should possess a machine-learning background and a deep-learning framework.<br />
