abstract = "In addition to providing for a more reliable distribution infrastructure, the smart grid promises to give the end users better pricing and usage information. It is thus interesting for them to be ready to take advantage of features such as dynamic energy pricing and real-time choice of operators. In this work, we propose a system to monitor and control an office environment and to couple it with the smart grid. The idea is to schedule the operation of devices according to policies defined by the users, in order to minimize the cost of operation while leaving unaffected user comfort and productivity. The implementation of the system and its testing in a living lab environment show interesting economic savings of an average of about 35% and in some cases even overall energy savings in the order of 10% for a building equipped with renewable generation plants, and economic and energy savings of 20% and 10%, respectively, for a building without local renewable installations.",

abstract = "Accurate human activity recognition (AR) is crucial for intelligent pervasive environments, e.g., energy-saving buildings. In order to gain precise and fine-grained AR results, a system must overcome partial observability of the environment and noisy, imprecise, and corrupted sensor data. In this work, we propose a rule-based AR architecture that effectively handles multiple-user, multiple-area situations, recognizing real-time office activities. The proposed solution is based on an ontological approach, using low-cost, binary, wireless sensors. We employ context consistency diagrams (CCD) as a key component for fault correction. A CCD is a data structure that provides a mechanism for probabilistic reasoning about the current situation and determines the most probable current situation in the presence of inconsistencies, conflicts, and ambiguities in sensor readings. The implementation of the system and its evaluation in a living lab environment show that the CCD corrects up to 46.8% of sensor data faults, improving overall recognition accuracy by up to 11.1%, thus achieving reliable recognition results from unreliable sensor data.",

In this work, we present an architecture for a smart home, starting from the lower device interconnectivity level up to the higher application layers that undertake the load of complex functionalities and provide a number of services to end-users. We claim that in order for smart homes to exhibit a genuinely intelligent behavior, the ability to compute compositions of individual devices automatically and dynamically is paramount. To this end, we incorporate into the architecture a composition component that employs artificial intelligence domain-independent planning to generate compositions at runtime, in a constantly evolving environment. We have implemented a fully working prototype that realizes such an architecture, and have evaluated it both in terms of performance as well as from the end-user point of view. The results of the evaluation show that the service-oriented architectural design and the support for dynamic compositions is quite efficient from the technical point of view, and that the system succeeds in satisfying the expectations and objectives of the users.",

Basing on a layered domotic architecture for smart embedded devices which builds on the paradigm of Service Oriented Computing, in this paper we focus on the pervasive layer and the requirements it has to fulfill, so as to realize a high degree of automation and serve the needs of the higher application levels of the architecture. We show how a discovery framework can take care of new devices independently of their protocols through the use of proxies. Because with the development of home network and service applications, different protocols and transmission modes are proposed. There are more digital devices and home appliances which compliance to the protocols. The proposed protocols are different and they are typically unable to interconnect with each other. We design and implement a middleware framework for smart homes to integrate protocols which are popular such as UPnP on OSGi framework and collaborating Zigbee and Bluetooth to converge various service oriented applications. Additionally, with the well-developed Zigbee and Bluetooth technology, majority of devices has been developed to support these technologies, we propose two new base drivers to integrate diverse devices communication protocol on our platform. The availability of standardized service type descriptions can further assist towards automating the tasks of integration and coordination through intelligent algorithms. From the technical point of view, the implementation builds on the OSGi/UPnP standards. An experimental setup for testing the discovery plugins for Bluetooth and ZigBee devices, along with an evaluation of the performance of the Bluetooth proxy verify that the proposed solution is a viable and effective one.",

abstract = "Building managers need effective tools to improve occupants' experiences considering constraints of energy efficiency. Current building management systems are limited to coordinating device services in simple and prefixed situations. Think of an office with lights offering services, such as turn on a light, which are invoked by the system to automatically control the lights. In spite of the evident potential for energy saving, the office occupants often end up in the dark, they have too much light when working with computers, or unnecessary lights are turned on. The office is thus not aware of the occupants' presence nor anticipates their activities. Our proposal is to coordinate services while anticipating occupant activities with sufficient accuracy. Finding and composing services that will support occupant activities is however a complex problem. The high number of services, the continuous transformation of buildings, and the various building standards imply a search through a vast number of possible contextual situations every time occupants perform activities. Our solution to this building coordination problem is based on Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning in combination with activity recognition. While HTN planning provides powerful means for composing services automatically, activity recognition is needed to identify occupant activities as soon as they occur. The output of this combination is a sequence of services that needs to be executed under the uncertainty of building environments. Our solution supports continuous context changes and service failures by using an advanced orchestration strategy. We design, implement and deploy a system in two cases, namely offices and a restaurant, in our own office building at the University of Groningen. We show energy savings in the order of 80% when compared to manual control in both cases, and 60% when compared to using only movement sensors. Moreover, we show that one can save a figure of 600 annually for the electricity costs of the restaurant. We use a survey to evaluate the experience of restaurant occupants. The majority of them are satisfied with the solution and find it useful. Finally, the technical evaluation provides insights into the efficiency of our system.",

abstract = "Modern software applications are increasingly deployed and distributed on infrastructures in the Cloud, and then offered as a service. Before the deployment process happens, these applications are being manually - or with some predefined scripts - composed from various smaller interdependent components. With the increase in demand for, and complexity of applications, the composition process becomes an arduous task often associated with errors and a suboptimal use of computer resources. To alleviate such a process, we introduce an approach that uses planning to automatically and dynamically compose applications ready for Cloud deployment. The industry may benefit from using automated planning in terms of support for product variability, sophisticated search in large spaces, fault tolerance, near-optimal deployment plans, etc. Our approach is based on Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning as it supports rich domain knowledge, component modularity, hierarchical representation of causality, and speed of computation. We describe a deployment using a formal component model for the Cloud, and we propose a way to define and solve an HTN planning problem from the deployment one. We employ an existing HTN planner to experimentally evaluate the feasibility of our approach.",

abstract = "Modern data analysis platforms all too often rely on the fact that the application and underlying data flow are static. That is, such platforms generally do not implement the capabilities to update individual components of running pipelines without restarting the pipeline, and they rely on data sources to remain unchanged while they are being used. However, in reality these assumptions do not hold: data scientists come up with new methods to analyze data all the time, and data sources are almost by definition dynamic. Companies performing data science analyses either need to accept the fact that their pipeline goes down during an update, or they should run a duplicate setup of their often costly infrastructure that continues the pipeline operations. In this research we present the Evolutionary Changes in Data Analysis (ECiDA) platform, with which we show how evolution and data science can go hand in hand. ECiDA aims to bridge the gap that is present between engineers that build large scale computation platforms on the one hand, and data scientists that perform analyses on large quantities of data on the other, while making change a first-class citizen. ECiDA allows data scientists to build their data science pipelines on scalable infrastructures, and make changes to them while they remain up and running. Such changes can range from parameter changes in individual pipeline components to general changes in network topology. Changes may also be initiated by an ECiDA pipeline itself as part of a diagnostic response: for instance, it may dynamically replace a data source that has become unavailable with one that is available. To make sure the platform remains in a consistent state while performing these updates, ECiDA uses a set of automatic formal verification methods, such as constraint programming and AI planning, to transparently check the validity of updates and prevent undesired behavior.",

abstract = "Indoor occupancy provides information about human occupation in the closed space, most notably, office and residential buildings. This information is useful in dwindling unnecessary energy usage, such as consumption in unoccupied spaces or energy-wasting due to unnecessarily active appliances. We present an empirical experiment on office occupancy detection using simple office sensors. We choose generic power meters and mobile phones. First, we classify beacon signals received by mobile phones into a room location. A workspace map is assumed to be available to facilitate the mapping between room locations and the occupancy state of users' workspace. Second, we infer the individual occupancy state utilizing the aggregated electricity consumption of occupant-related devices (i.e., monitors) in shared offices. The later solution helps to keep costs and intrusiveness level low compared to deploying a power meter for each device or user. We experiment in an work environment with two shared offices, a personal office, and a social corner involving five volunteers. Given the acquired data, three techniques based on machine learning, optimization, and probabilistic approach are implemented and compared to evaluate their performance. The results indicate that localization and occupancy based on beaconing works best for three of the five volunteers, reaching 95% F-measure. Further findings shows that occupancy inference based on the aggregated power consumption performs well for the four volunteers when using Decision Tree classification, reaching more than 90% F-measure. Our effort on the fusion of two modalities gives a positive result for all five volunteers, ranging from 92% to 99% F-measure.",

In this paper, we propose a method of modelling the task as a Dynamic CSP in a way that avoids unnecessary recalculations with new events in the environment. We present a Dependency Graph data structure, which not only allows to reduce CSP search space for every consecutive sensor event by detecting only affected parts of the environment, but also allows to give enough information to users of the system to specify the exact reasons of system's decisions, even with a large number of constraints. We formally prove that partial recalculation of affected parts still keeps the full environment globally satisfied and globally optimal. The evaluation of the system in the living lab showed real-time responses for all events. Additional simulated performance experiments showed that the Dependency Graph approach consistently outperforms the straightforward CSP representation. The experiments also showed that the clusterization of the environment has a noticeable effect on the performance, with highly clusterized environments requiring less computations.",

The structure of a problem heavily influences its computational complexity, however, and problems with a restricted structure constitute one of the general classes of tractable problems. This paper explores the community structure of constraint satisfaction problems, a type of structure already found to be important for SAT problems that is inherent to certain real-world domains. The community structure of the instances of the MiniZinc Challenge of 2019 was identified, and its correlation with the search times of four state-of-the-art solvers as well as with the tree-width of the instances was analysed. The results reveal the strong community structure of many of the instances, although the strength of the community structure seems to only marginally affect the search times. On the other hand, a strong correlation between the community structure and the tree-width is observed, where stronger community structure suggests better decomposability. Taking community structure into account more explicitly during the search process may, therefore, allow constraints solvers to solve problems with strong community structure more efficiently.",

Based on such information one can optimally regulate lighting and climatization based on the actual presence and absence of users. Conventional approaches are based on movement detection, which are cheap and easy to deploy, but are imprecise and offer coarse information. We propose a power monitoring system as a source of occupancy information. The approach is based on sub-metering at the level of room circuit breakers. The proposed method tackles the problem of indoor office occupancy detection based on statistical approaches, thus contributing to building context awareness which, in turn, is a crucial stepping stone for energy-efficient buildings. The key advantage of the proposed approach is to be low intrusive, especially when compared with image- or tag-based solutions, while still being sufficiently precise in its classification. Such classification is based on nearest neighbors and neural networks machine learning approaches, both in sequential and non-sequential implementations. To test the viability, precision, and saving potential of the proposed approach we deploy in an actual office over several months. We find that the room-level sub-metering can acquire precise, fine-grained occupancy context for up to three people, with averaged kappa measures of 93-95% using either the nearest neighbors or neural networks based approaches.",

These systems are based on processing pipelines where operations on data are performed in a chain of consecutive steps. Normally, the operations performed by these pipelines are set at design time, and any changes to their functionality require the applications to be restarted. This is not always acceptable, for example, when we cannot afford downtime or when a long-running calculation would lose significant progress. The introduction of variation points to distributed processing pipelines allows for on-the-fly updating of individual analysis steps. In this paper, we extend such basic variation point functionality to provide fully automated reconfiguration of the processing steps within a running pipeline through an automated planner. We have enabled pipeline modeling through constraints. Based on these constraints, we not only ensure that configurations are compatible with type but also verify that expected pipeline functionality is achieved. Furthermore, automating the reconfiguration process simplifies its use, in turn allowing users with less development experience to make changes. The system can automatically generate and validate pipeline configurations that achieve a specified goal, selecting from operation definitions available at planning time. It then automatically integrates these configurations into the running pipeline. We verify the system through the testing of a proof-of-concept implementation. The proof of concept also shows promising results when reconfiguration is performed frequently.",

The static selection of a model risks suboptimal performance as data patterns evolve, while frequent redeployments increase operational costs. This paper proposes a self-adaptive system that autonomously selects interchangeable models for processing streaming data while balancing the tradeoff of performance and redeployment frequency. Inspired by the MAPE-K reference model, our approach utilizes an adaptive model selection control loop to continuously monitor model performance on production and experimental data. “what-if” environments are introduced to collect additional experimental data, simulating production-like scenarios. A selection algorithm that employs two distinct adaptation policies is introduced that strategically plans the selection of the most suitable module for upcoming data. Leveraging a learning-based method, we improve the efficiency of our system by recognizing the patterns of selection eliminating the need for further experimental data collection. Empirical evaluation on an energy forecasting use case spans over 16 years of data demonstrates a substantial reduction in errors up to 34\% compared to the best static selection, affirming the proposed framework's effectiveness. Our findings reveal the potential to discontinue experimental “what-if analyses with just 12\% of historical data, which underlines the practicality of our adaptive strategy on a long-lasting task.",

abstract = "Pressure and flow estimation in water distribution networks (WDNs) allows water management companies to optimize their control operations. For many years, mathematical simulation tools have been the most common approach to reconstructing an estimate of the WDNs hydraulics. However, pure physics-based simulations involve several challenges, for example, partially observable data, high uncertainty, and extensive manual calibration. Thus, data-driven approaches have gained traction to overcome such limitations. In this work, we combine physics-based modeling and graph neural networks (GNN), a data-driven approach, to address the pressure estimation problem. Our work has two main contributions. First, a training strategy that relies on random sensor placement making our GNN-based estimation model robust to unexpected sensor location changes. Second, a realistic evaluation protocol that considers real temporal patterns and noise injection to mimic the uncertainties intrinsic to real-world scenarios. As a result, a new state-of-the-art model, GAT with Residual Connections, for pressure estimation is available. Our model surpasses the performance of previous studies on several WDNs benchmarks, showing a reduction of absolute error of ≈40% on average.",

abstract = "Solving constraint satisfaction problems often involves a large amount of redundant exploration stemming from the existence of subproblems whose information can be reused for other subproblems. Subproblem dominance is a general notion of reusability that arises when one subproblem imposes more constraints on the remaining part of the search than another subproblem and allows the search to reuse the solutions of the dominating subproblem for the dominated subproblem. The search can exploit subproblem dominance by storing the subproblems that have been explored in a cache and abandoning the current subproblem whenever the cache contains a subproblem that dominates it. While using caching makes it possible to solve problems where subproblem dominance arises orders of magnitude faster, storing all of these subproblems can require a substantial amount of memory, making it impractical in many cases. This paper analyses the dominance between different subproblems for various constraint problems, revealing that only a relatively small number of subproblems dominate other subproblems. Based on these findings, two types of strategies are proposed for reducing the number of subproblems stored in the cache: limiting the number of subproblems that can be stored in the cache and periodically cleaning up the cache. An experimental evaluation demonstrates that these strategies provide an effective instrument for reducing the memory consumption of caching, allowing it to be used on a larger scale. However, there is a trade-off between saving memory and reducing redundant exploration, as removing subproblems from the cache may prevent dominance from being detected for certain subproblems.",

abstract = "The treewidth is a measure that quantifies how tree-like a graph is. Its interest stems from the fact that many problems on graphs that are NP-complete for arbitrary graphs become solvable in polynomial time when restricted to graphs with bounded treewidth. Unfortunately, computing the treewidth of a graph is itself an NP-complete problem. A preprocessing technique that has proven to be highly effective at reducing the size of a graph for which the treewidth is to be computed is splitting the graph into multiple smaller subgraphs using separators that are safe for treewidth, allowing the treewidth of the complete graph to be computed as the maximum treewidth over these subgraphs. This paper introduces a new class of safe separators that largely generalises the existing classes of safe separators and opens up the possibility of designing even more powerful preprocessing techniques. An experimental evaluation on a set of synthetic graphs with known safe separators demonstrates that decomposing the graphs using their safe separators has the potential to reduce the execution time of algorithms by up to 10 times in many cases, with a maximum of more than 100 times in the most favourable cases. A heuristic decomposition algorithm is also presented that uses the community structure of a graph to decompose it into subgraphs. The evaluation of this heuristic algorithm on both the synthetic graphs and the graphs from the PACE challenge of 2017 using the same algorithms shows that the potential reduction in execution time is largely maintained while having only a slight impact on the quality as a result of the heuristic-based decomposition.",

abstract = "Concurrent business processes frequently suffer from mutual interference, especially in highly distributed service environments, where resources are shared among different stakeholders. Interference may be caused by supposedly stable case-related data, which are modified externally during process execution and may result in undesirable business outcomes. One way to address this problem is through the specification of dependency scopes, that cover critical parts of the process, and intervention processes, which are triggered at runtime to repair the inconsistencies. However, for complex processes, the manual specification of the appropriate intervention processes at design time can be particularly time-consuming and error-prone, while it is difficult to ensure that all important intervention cases are taken into account. To overcome this limitation, we propose an approach for automating the generation of intervention processes at runtime, by using domain-independent AI planning techniques. This way, intervention processes are composed on the fly, taking into account the characteristics of the business process in execution, the available compensation activities, and the properties that have to be fulfilled to recover from the erroneous situation.

Any form of automation and support we can bring to the tasks of maintenance and evolution are highly beneficial.

This has severe consequences: even if these processes properly terminate, they may lead to undesirable outcomes from a business perspective. As the disruptions are primarily visible to external stakeholders, identifying such erroneous situations is complex and organizations are often unaware of these cases. In this paper, a methodology is developed to identify interfering processes. A software tool is developed to automatically identify and analyze the erroneous situations using simulation and LTL checking. The simulation results are validated against the LTL properties of interference, in order to ensure that the identified erroneous paths are a result of process interference. The magnitude of the problem can be analyzed, as interference is investigated for each execution path. This method has been applied at a large energy company and a large telecom company in the Netherlands. The analysis shows that process interference indeed leads to erroneous situations in a significant number of cases (around 10% of the paths lead to faulty results, with exceptions of 70%), including the possibility of wrong invoices, of ordering new products with wrong customer data, etc. The results clearly show the importance and relevance of these business problems.",

abstract = "Efficient utilization of resources plays an important role in the performance of large scale task processing. In cases where heterogeneous types of resources are used within the same application, it is hard to achieve good utilization of all of the different types of resources. By taking advantage of recent developments in cloud infrastructure that enable the use of dynamic clusters of resources, and by dynamically altering the size of the available resources for all the different resource types, the overall utilization of resources, however, can be improved. Starting from this premise, this paper discusses a solution that aims to provide a generic algorithm to estimate the desired ratios of instance processing tasks as well as ratios of the resources that are used by these instances, without the necessity for trial runs or a priori knowledge of the execution steps. These ratios are then used as part of an adaptive system that is able to reconfigure itself to maximize utilization. To verify the solution, a reference framework which adaptively manages clusters of functionally different VMs to host a calculation scenario is implemented. Experiments are conducted based on a compute-heavy use case in which the probability of underground pipeline failures is determined based on the settlement of soils. These experiments show that the solution is capable of eliminating large amounts of under-utilization, resulting in increased throughput and lower lead times.",

We present the RuGPlanner, which models the planning task as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem. In order to address the requirements put forward by service domains, the RuGPlanner is endowed with a number of special features. These include a knowledge-level representation to model uncertainty about the initial state and the outcome of sensing actions, and efficient handling of numeric-valued variables, inputs to actions or observational effects. In addition, it generates plans with a high level of parallelism, it supports a rich declarative language for expressing extended goals, and allows for continual plan revision to deal with sensing outputs, failures, long response times or timeouts, as well as the activities of external agents. The proposed planning framework is evaluated based on a number of scenarios to demonstrate its feasibility and efficiency in several planning domains and execution circumstances which reflect concerns from different service environments.",

Energy saving is one of the promises of Smart Buildings. This can be achieved by controlling the HVAC system, lights, and other energy consuming appliances in relation to the activities of people in the building. In particular, presence is an important factor to consider. By using beacons such as those based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and mobile phones, one can deduct occupancy information by interacting, over WiFi, with a central server. In the present study, we investigate BLE utilization for transmitting the occupancy data to the server using off-the-self devices with several parameters, e.g., distance, packet size, and line-of-sight state. Furthermore, we propose a utilization of size-constrained BLE packets for transmitting occupancy data, which was previously only possible by means of HTTP over WiFi. The result shows that it is possible to transmit occupancy data via BLE, despite of its resource constraints. Bluetooth is also shown to be about 30% more energy efficient than WiFi to perform occupancy data transmission, i.e., the mobile phone has 16 hours and 38 minutes of battery life when running on BLE communication scheme and 14 hours and 46 minutes in WiFi communication.",

In this paper, we propose a solution based on the emerging Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) standard and off-the-shelf hardware. Such approach proves to satisfy economic constraints, while challenging in terms of accurate location. To translate beacon signals into locations, we consider several approaches, i.e., cosine similarity, nearest neighbourhood classification, and the nearest beacon. Our experiments indicate a vector based approach as the most suited one.

In this paper, we illustrate a proposal for occupancy detection which is low intrusive; it is based on equipment typically available in modern offices such as room-level power-metering and an app running on workers’ mobile phones. For power metering, we collect the aggregated power consumption and disaggregate the load of each device. For the mobile phone, we use the Received Signal Strength (RSS) of BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) nodes deployed around workspaces to localize the phone in a room. We test the system in our offices.

The disag- gregation problem becomes then more challenging and, at the same time, crucial for understanding the user context. In fact, from the disaggregation one can deduce the number of people in an office room, their activities, and current energy needs. In this paper, we review the characteristics of office appliances load disaggregation efforts. We then illustrate a proposal for a classification model based on Recur- rent Neural Network (RNN).

One of the several classes of tractable problems that exist contains all the problems with a restricted structure of the constraint scopes. This paper studies community structure, a particular type of restricted structure underpinning a class of tractable SAT problems with potentially similar relevance to CSPs. Using the modularity, it explores the community structure of a wide variety of problems with both academic and industrial relevance. Its impact on the search times of several general solvers, as well as one that uses tree-decomposition, is also analysed to determine whether constraint solvers exploit this type of structure. Nearly all CSP instances have a strong community structure, and those belonging to the same class have comparable modularity values. For the general solvers, strong correlations between the community structure and the search times are not apparent. A more definite correlation exists between the modularity and the search times of the tree-decomposition, suggesting that it might, in part, be able to take advantage of the community structure. However, combined with the relatively strong correlation between the modularity and the tree-width, it could also indicate a similarity between these two measures.",

This disparity can be attributed to multiple factors, such as the unique challenges inherent to ML development and the absence of a unified framework for incorporating services into this process. In this paper, we shed light on the disparities between services-oriented computing and machine learning development. We propose “Everything as a Module” (XaaM), a framework designed to encapsulate every ML artifacts including models, code, data, and configurations as individual modules, to bridge this gap. We propose a set of additional steps that need to be taken to empower machine learning development using services-oriented computing via an architecture that facilitates efficient management and orchestration of complex ML systems. By leveraging the best practices of services-oriented computing, we believe that machine learning development can achieve a higher level of maturity, improve the efficiency of the development process, and ultimately, facilitate the more effective creation of machine learning applications.",

However, some of these conventional approaches lead to accuracy overestimation. In particular, sliding windows for data segmentation followed by standard random k-fold cross validation, produce biased results. An analysis of previous literature and present-day studies, surprisingly, shows that these are common approaches in state-of-the-art studies on HAR. It is important to raise awareness in the scientific community about this problem, whose negative effects are being overlooked. Otherwise, publications of biased results lead to papers that report lower accuracies, with correct unbiased methods, harder to publish. Several experiments with different types of datasets and different types of classification models allow us to exhibit the problem and show it persists independently of the method or dataset.",

One of the key requirements of such domains is the ability to address the incomplete knowledge problem, as well as recovering from failures that may occur during execution.

Despite recent achievements in research and actual implementation of e-government in practice, numerous questions still remain on how to achieve full interoperability and dynamic reconfiguration of e-government services, with better accessibility, more transparency and manageability. The service-oriented architecture (SOA) paradigm provides the necessary theoretical and technological support for the desired electronic government systems to become a reality. It satisfies the demand for a highly distributed heterogeneous environment with a large number of autonomous services and their providers together with users with their own goals and preferences. Therefore, the combination of the e-government domain and SOA appears to be natural, as SOA provides an ideal platform to achieve the goal of a citizen-oriented and citizen-centric government organization. This workshop will provide a forum to discuss how the SOA paradigm may facilitate further advances in e-government research as well as best practice examples of already implemented and applied solutions in the context of e-government. We plan to have both formal and informal presentations on theoretical, technical and implementation aspects of the application of SOA for e-government challenges and issues.",

This allows us to perform a complex reconfiguration as an atomic step and analyze it using formal verification techniques. Specifically, we formalize the structure of connectors as typed hypergraphs and use critical pair and state space analyses for verification of dynamic reconfigurations. We provide a full implementation of our approach in a framework that includes tools for the definition, analysis, and execution of reconfigurations, and is integrated with two execution engines for Reo.

abstract = "Interaction with web services enabled marketplaces would be greatly facilitated if users were given a high level service request language to express their goals in complex business domains. This could be achieved by using a planning framework which monitors the execution of planned goals against predefined standard business processes and interacts with the user to achieve goal satisfaction. We present a planning architecture that accepts high level requests, expressed in XSRL (Xml Service Request Language). The planning framework is based on the principle of interleaving planning and execution. This is accomplished on the basis of refinement and revision as new service-related information is gathered from UDDI and web services instances, and as execution circumstances necessitate change. The system interacts with the user whenever confirmation or verification is needed.",

One of the greatest difficulties in developing middleware for smart homes is that this kind of systems are extremely difficult to test and verify. We propose to reduce the testing costs by replacing actual home services with virtual stubs behaving as if they were actual hardware installed somewhere in the house and, most importantly, to visualize the behaviour of the home to give the user the impression and feedback of being in a real home.",

abstract = "For business processes supported by service-oriented information systems, concurrent execution of business processes still may yield undesired business outcomes as a result of process interference. For instance, concurrent processes may partially depend on a semantically identical process variable, causing inconsistencies during process execution. Current design-time verification of service-based processes is not always sufficient to identify these issues. To identify and resolve potentially erroneous situations, run-time handling of interference is required. In this paper, dependency scopes are defined to represent the dependencies between processes and data sources. In addition, intervention patterns are developed to repair inconsistencies using dynamic reconfiguration during execution of the pro-cess. These concepts are implemented on top of a BPMS platform and tested on a real case study, based on the implementation of a Dutch Law in e-Government.",

abstract = "Coordination in Reo emerges from the composition of the behavioural constraints of primitives, such as channels, in a component connector. Understanding and implementing Reo, however, has been challenging due to the interaction of the channel metaphor, which is an inherently local notion, and the non-local nature of the constraints imposed by composition. In this paper, the channel metaphor takes a back seat. We focus on the behavioural constraints imposed by the composition of primitives and phrase the semantics of Reo as a constraint satisfaction problem. Not only does this provide a clear description of the behaviour of Reo connectors in terms of synchronisation and data flow constraints, it also paves the way for new implementation techniques based on constraint satisfaction. We also demonstrate that this approach is more efficient than the existing techniques based on connector colouring. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

The inevitable drawback of such systems is that raw data collected from sensors is often noisy, corrupted, and imprecise. Erroneous sensor readings create uncertainties and ambiguous interpretations. Thus creating an interpretation challenge for the context-aware system that needs to reason about possible states of only partially observable subjects.We propose a mechanism for pervasive context-aware systems to process the information gathered from sensors so to obtain knowledge about possible environment states. This includes both the ability to reason about a situation with incomplete knowledge and to cope with erroneous contexts. We present a probabilistic approach to reason about the likelihood of each particular situation, state of a variable, and variable interdependence. The evaluation shows that the proposed approach is applicable to real-time context inference problems.",
