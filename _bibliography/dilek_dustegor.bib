   abstract = {This article focuses on developing both statistical and machine learning approaches for forecasting hourly electricity demand in Ontario. The novelties of this study include (i) identifying essential factors that have a significant effect on electricity consumption, (ii) the execution of a Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA) to optimize the model hyperparameters, (iii) hybridizing the BOA with the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average with exogenous inputs (SARIMAX) and nonlinear autoregressive networks with exogenous input (NARX) for modeling separately short-term electricity demand for the first time, (iv) comparing the model&rsquo;s performance using several performance indicators and computing efficiency, and (v) validation of the model performance using unseen data. Six features (viz., snow depth, cloud cover, precipitation, temperature, irradiance toa, and irradiance surface) were found to be significant. The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of five consecutive weekdays for all seasons in the hybrid BOA-NARX is obtained at about 3%, while a remarkable variation is observed in the hybrid BOA-SARIMAX. BOA-NARX provides an overall steady Relative Error (RE) in all seasons (1~6.56%), while BOA-SARIMAX provides unstable results (Fall: 0.73~2.98%; Summer: 8.41~14.44%). The coefficient of determination (R2) values for both models are &gt;0.96. Overall results indicate that both models perform well; however, the hybrid BOA-NARX reveals a stable ability to handle the day-ahead electricity load forecasts.},

Water quality monitoring is thus paramount, especially for domestic water. Traditionally used laboratory-based testing approaches are manual, costly, time consuming, and lack real-time feedback. Recently developed systems utilizing wireless sensor network (WSN) technology have reported weaknesses in energy management, data security, and communication coverage. Due to the recent advances in Internet-of-Things (IoT) that can be applied in the development of more efficient, secure, and cheaper systems with real-time capabilities, we present here a survey aimed at summarizing the current state of the art regarding IoT based smart water quality monitoring systems (IoT-WQMS) especially dedicated for domestic applications. In brief, this study probes into common water-quality monitoring (WQM) parameters, their safe-limits for drinking water, related smart sensors, critical review, and ratification of contemporary IoT-WQMS via a proposed empirical metric, analysis, and discussion and, finally, design recommendations for an efficient system. No doubt, this study will benefit the developing field of smart homes, offices, and cities.},

The job market landscape, however, more than ever dynamic, is evolving due to the globalization, automation, and recent advances in Artificial Intelligence. Identifying the significant factors affecting employability, as well as the requirements of the new job market can tremendously help all stakeholders. Knowing their weaknesses and strengths, students might better plan their career. Instructors can focus on more appropriate skill sets to meet the requirements of rapidly evolving labor markets. Program managers can anticipate and improve their curriculum to build new competencies, both for educating, training and reskilling current and future workers. All these combined efforts certainly can contribute to increasing employability. Data driven and machine learning techniques have been extensively used in various fields of educational data mining. More and more studies are investigating data mining techniques for the prediction of employability. Yet, these studies show a lot of variation, for instance, with respect to the data used, the methods adopted, or even the research questions posed. In this paper, we aim to depict a clear picture of the art, clarifying for each standard step of data mining process, the differences, and similarities of these studies, along with further suggestions.

Early detection of students at risk, along with preventive measures, can drastically improve their success. Lately, machine learning techniques have been extensively used for prediction purpose. While there is a plethora of success stories in the literature, these techniques are mainly accessible to “computer science”, or more precisely, “artificial intelligence” literate educators. Indeed, the effective and efficient application of data mining methods entail many decisions, ranging from how to define student’s success, through which student attributes to focus on, up to which machine learning method is more appropriate to the given problem. This study aims to provide a step-by-step set of guidelines for educators willing to apply data mining techniques to predict student success. For this, the literature has been reviewed, and the state-of-the-art has been compiled into a systematic process, where possible decisions and parameters are comprehensively covered and explained along with arguments. This study will provide to educators an easier access to data mining techniques, enabling all the potential of their application to the field of education.},

   abstract = {Predicting the academic standing of a student at the graduation time can be very useful, for example, in helping institutions select among candidates, or in helping potentially weak students in overcoming educational challenges. Most studies use individual course grades to represent college performance, with a recent trend towards using grade point average (GPA) per semester. It is unknown however which of these representations can yield the best predictive power, due to the lack of a comparative study. To answer this question, a case study is conducted that generates two sets of classification models, using respectively individual course grades and GPAs. Comprehensive sets of experiments are conducted, spanning different student data, using several well-known machine learning algorithms, and trying various prediction window sizes. Results show that using course grades yields better accuracy if the prediction is done before the third term, whereas using GPAs achieves better accuracy otherwise. Most importantly, variance analysis on the experiment results reveals interesting insights easily generalizable: individual course grades with short prediction window induces noise, and using GPAs with long prediction window causes over-simplification. The demonstrated analytical approach can be applied to any dataset to determine when to use which college performance representation for enhanced prediction.},

The success of the transition is dependent on householder acceptance. This research studies the public's disposition toward a smarter grid. The Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia is taken as a case study through a field questionnaire to assess public knowledge about energy sources and environmental impacts on the environments, people's disposition toward a smarter electric grid, and the main motivations for undergoing this transition. A logit model is used to investigate determinants. Stated willingness is taken as a variable representing an individual's disposition. We found that the public is willing to use green energy, accept smart meters, or become co-producers. However, their fear of unknown technologies and perceptions about their high cost are major obstacles to their adoption. Enhancive knowledge, especially about ecological sensitivity, and governmental incentives will help to win public acceptance. Also, government subsidies that lower prices should be cut and dynamic pricing should be implemented to motivate electricity saving behavior.},

   abstract = {© 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited. Purpose: This study aims to investigate how a very particular learning environment, namely, partition rooms, affect students’ teaching experience and further explore if students’ learning styles is a pertinent determinant. Partition rooms are very common in Saudi Arabia when lectures are held by male instructors for female students. The male instructor delivers his lesson behind a glass wall, creating an environment of limited visual and auditory interaction. Various digital tools are present, meant to overcome the gap caused by the lack of direct student–teacher contact. Design/methodology/approach: The researchers collected data from a sample of 109 female students who are studying at Level 4 Computer Science Department, College of Computer Sciences and Information Technology, at a public university in Saudi Arabia. All of them experienced a minimum of two courses undertaken in a partition room. The survey consists of two parts with a total of 53 questions. The first 20 questions were adopted from the perceptual learning style preference questionnaire (PLSP). Findings: Research findings reveal that students are affected differently by the various dimensions of the partition room depending on their learning style. Originality/value: There are fewer results in the literature that study learners of our particular group, namely, Saudi females. The study focuses on students studying IT and related fields. This study is almost unique, as most studies of the kind are related to the experience of females learning English as a foreign language. Therefore, the authors’ research gives much-needed insight into the conditions and perceptions of female students studying toward their degree in a technical field.},

An unexpected result of this study is that female students occasionally choose not to use the technology available in partition-rooms, to avoid undesirable facial exposure. Background: The main purpose of partition-rooms is to prevent male instructors from seeing female students' faces. In learning environments where instructors and students are physically separated, technology is expected to play an integral role in bridging the gap. In one side of partition-rooms, female students use their own mobile devices, such as laptops, tablets and mobile phones, for course activities and communication; in the other side, the instructor has various digital teaching equipment provided by the institution. Research Question: What effect does a partition-room's physical environment have on female students' academic performance, satisfaction, technology efficacy, and perceived learning? What effect does a partition-room's social environment have on female students' academic performance, satisfaction, technology efficacy, and perceived learning? Methodology: Both quantitative and qualitative approaches were followed. Quantitative results were obtained from a student questionnaire. Qualitative data was gathered in a focus group session. Findings: The communication benefits offered by technology are impaired by both the physical context and the cultural-social context. The latter emerged during focus group discussions where students said that their faces might by revealed in the light emitted by their devices. Thus, local culture and social context limit the benefits of using digital technology in the classroom.},

This redundancy can be used as a confirmation mechanism within a wide-area protection scheme to avoid unnecessary or false tripping due to protection component failure or disturbance. Furthermore, this redundancy turns the sensor configuration problem into an optimization problem with regard to fault detection and location.

   abstract = {In this study, the model-based fault detection and isolation (FDI) approach of parity-space is adapted to the diagnosis of sensor faults in power systems. Hardware redundancy is conventionally utilized to overcome this problem. However, this is an expensive solution. Instead, we propose to detect and locate faults by the systematic use of the system's analytical redundancy, with a global view of the system. This redundancy can be used to detect and isolate sensor failure as well. We also give necessary and sufficient conditions for a sensor network to be able detect faults, sensor failures included. Hence, the sensor configuration problem boils down to an optimization problem that can be intelligently guided by our method. The principle of parity-space approach is described in detail and illustrated on a simple power system model. The method is then validated through simulation. ©2010 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Any power system, either an integrated power system in an all-electric ship or a utility power system, needs to be highly reliable. Reliability of a complex system strongly depends on the possibility of detecting faults and isolating them from each other, i.e., on the monitoring potential of the system. The area of power system engineering that is concerned with the fault detection and isolation is called protection. As power systems becoming more and more complex, current standards for their protection should be adjusted accordingly to meet the challenges associated with increased system complexity. The standard approach used in power system protection is local, that is, current and voltage sensors are placed at or near individual breakers that open up to isolate a fault (short circuit). Coordination between breakers is achieved indirectly by setting the voltage or current trip points of the breakers differently so they open up in a desired sequence. Wide-area (global) protection is a new research direction. Wide-area protection schemes provide protection at more unified, global level than local protection schemes, and often operate as a backup level of protection. However, these schemes are usually developed manually, that is, the arrangement of protective actions within areas are made by hand, following heuristic considerations. More systematic and automated approaches are required for successful wide-area protection of larger systems. The objective of the current study is to adapt the model-based fault detection and isolation approach based on structural analysis to power systems in order to evaluate the monitoring potential of a given power system topology (architecture) in a systematic and automated manner. A new methodology is applied to evaluate the monitoring potential of a few simple topologies. © 2008 IEEE.},

   abstract = {A water for injection system supplies chilled sterile water as a solvent for pharmaceutical products. There are ultimate requirements for the quality of the sterile water, and the consequence of a fault in temperature or in flow control within the process may cause a loss of one or more batches of the production. Early diagnosis of faults is hence of considerable interest for this process. This study investigates the properties of multiple matchings with respect to isolability, and it suggests to explore the topologies of multiple use-modes for the process and to employ active techniques for fault isolation to enhance structural isolability of faults. The suggested methods are validated on a high-fidelity simulation of the process.},

System's evolution is one of these points to be considered. The main contribution of this chapter is an adaptive/evolutive algorithm that avoids unnecessary duplication of work by efficiently making use of already generated results. The benefit of such an adaptive algorithm is twofold. First, it enables determining structural properties and performing structural analysis efficiently when system structure changes. Second, such an algorithm is an important tool for safe system design. The chapter recalls the main steps of structural analysis for FDI, analyzes the different kinds of structure modifications that can occur, treats the constraint removal case, proposes a solution to the constraint addition case, and finally, summarizes the whole analysis. © 2007 Copyright © 2007 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

The developed technique considers implementation issues therefore it has a more realistic point of view compared to classical structural approaches. First practical issues that can be encountered such as computational complexity or implementation considerations are introduced. Then the way of incorporating them to the existing structural analysis framework is explained. Finally, we show how the Stable Marriage Problem can be successfully adapted in order to choose the most suited matching that leads to residual computational sequences.
