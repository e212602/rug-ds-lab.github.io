  abstract = {Current network functions build heavily on fixed programmed rules and lack capacity to support more expressive learning models, e.g. brain-inspired Cognitive computational models using neuromorphic computations. The major reason for this shortcoming is the huge energy consumption and limitation in expressiveness by the underlying TCAM-based digital packet processors. In this research, we show that recent emerging technologies from the analog domain have a high potential in supporting network functions with energy efficiency and more expressiveness, so called cognitive functions. We propose an analog packet processing architecture building on a novel technology named Memristors. We develop a novel analog match-action memory called Probabilistic Content-Addressable Memory (pCAM) for supporting deterministic and probabilistic match functions. We develop the programming abstractions and show the support of pCAM for an active queue management-based analog network function. The analysis over an experimental dataset of a memristor chip showed only 0.01 fJ/bit/cell of energy consumption for corresponding analog computations which is 50 times less than digital computations.},

 abstract   = {The Internet makes use of high performance network switches in order to route network traffic from end users to servers. Despite line-rate performance, the current switches consume huge energy and cannot support more expressive learning models, like cognitive functions using neuromorphic computations. The major reason is the use of transistors in the underlying Ternary Content-Addressable Memory (TCAM) which is volatile and supports digital computations only. These shortcomings can be bypassed by developing network memories building on novel components, like Memristors, due to their nonvolatile, nanoscale and analog storage/processing characteristics. In this paper, we propose the use of a novel memristor-based Probabilistic Associative Memory, PAmM, which provides both digital (deterministic) and analog (probabilistic) outputs for supporting cognitive computational models in network switches. The traditional digital operations can be supported by a memristor-based energy efficient TCAM, called TCAmMCogniGron. Building on PAmM and TCAmMCogniGron, we propose a novel network switching architecture and analyze its energy efficiency over the experimental dataset of a Nb-doped SrTiO3 memristive device. The results show that the proposed network switching architecture consumes only 0.01 fJ/bit/cell energy for analog compute operations which is at least 50 times less than the digital operations.},

  title     = {On Memristors for Enabling Energy Efficient and Enhanced Cognitive Network Functions},
  abstract  = {The high performance requirements of nowadays computer networks are limiting their ability to support important requirements of the future. Two important properties essential in assuring cost-efficient computer networks and supporting new challenging network scenarios are operating energy efficient and supporting cognitive computational models. These requirements are hard to fulfill without challenging the current architecture behind network packet processing elements such as routers and switches. Notably, these are currently dominated by the use of traditional transistor-based components. In this article, we contribute with an in-depth analysis of alternative architectural design decisions to improve the energy footprint and computational capabilities of future network packet processors by shifting from transistor-based components to a novel component named Memristor . A memristor is a computational component characterized by non-volatile operations on a physical state, mostly represented in form of (electrical) resistance. Its state can be read or altered by input signals, e.g. electrical pulses, where the future state always depends on the past state. Unlike in traditional von Neumann architectures, the principles behind memristors impose that memory operations and computations are inherently colocated. In combination with the non-volatility, this allows to build memristors at nanoscale size and significantly reduce the energy consumption. At the same time, memristors appear to be highly suitable to model cognitive functionality due to the state dependence transitions in the memristor. In cognitive architectures, our survey contributes to the study of memristor-based Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) used for storage of cognitive rules inside packet processors. Moreover, we analyze the memristor-based novel cognitive computational architectures built upon self-learning capabilities by harnessing from non-volatility and state-based response of memristors (including reconfigurable architectures, reservoir computation architectures, neural network architectures and neuromorphic computing architectures).},

  abstract  = {The Internet relies heavily on programmable match-action processors for matching network packets against locally available network rules and taking actions, such as forwarding and modification of network packets. This match-action process must be performed at high speed, i.e., commonly within one clock cycle, using a specialized memory unit called Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM). Building on transistor-based CMOS designs, state-of-the-art TCAM architectures have high energy consumption and lack resilient designs for incorporating novel technologies for performing appropriate actions. In this article, we motivate the use of a novel fundamental component, the ‘Memristor’, for the development of TCAM architecture for match-action processing. Memristors can provide energy efficiency, non-volatility and better resource density as compared to transistors. We have proposed a novel memristor-based TCAM architecture called TCAmMCogniGron, built upon the voltage divider principle and requiring only two memristors and five transistors for storage and search operations compared to sixteen transistors in the traditional TCAM architecture. We analyzed its performance over an experimental data set of Nb-doped SrTiO3-based memristor. The analysis of TCAmMCogniGron showed promising power consumption statistics of 16 uW and 1 uW for match and mismatch operations along with twice the improvement in resources density as compared to the traditional architectures.},

Our research shows that ‘security’ and ‘anonymity’ are the most frequent keywords associated with Tor research studies. Quantitative analysis shows that the majority of research studies on Tor focus on ‘deanonymization’ the design of a breaching strategy. The second most frequent topic is analysis of path selection algorithms to select more resilient paths. Analysis shows that the majority of experimental studies derived their results by deploying private testbeds while others performed simulations by developing custom simulators. No consistent parameters have been used for Tor performance analysis. The majority of authors performed throughput and latency analysis.},

We provide descriptions for an illustrative base case of three users and one eavesdropper and expand it for the case of N users with C channels and M eavesdroppers. Repeated application of the MuGKeG algorithm on the order of O(logN) allows scaling the size of the group in the order of millions. We provide an analytical closed-form solution for the entropy of the secret group key generated when eavesdroppers follow an optimal attack strategy, and verify it by ns-3 simulations. Comparison with previous state-of-the-art schemes suggests that MuGKeG can provide upto 20 kbps increase in secrecy rate with a scalable key size.},

The OpenFlow protocol is one of a number of technologies that enables this decoupling and, in effect, commodifies network equipment. As of now, there is still limited work that has been done towards modeling the transit delay across OpenFlow switches experienced by network traffic. In this work we develop a stochastic model for the path latency in Open vSwitch (used together with a POX controller) based on measurements made in experiments performed on three different platforms which include 1) Mininet, 2) MikroTik RouterBoard 750GL and 3) GENI testbed softswitch. We propose a log-normal mix model (LNMM) and show that it offers a R2 value of greater than 0.90 for most of our experiments. We also demonstrate how the M/M/1 models proposed in earlier studies is a poor fit.},

In this study, we present a novel technique called lexi-temporal clustering (LTC), which identifies key events. LTC uses k-means clustering and we explore the use of various distance measures for clustering using Euclidean, cosine similarity and Manhattan distance. We collected three original data sets consisting of Twitter microblog posts covering sporting events, consisting of a cricket and two football matches. The match summaries generated by LTC were compared against standard summaries taken from sports sections of various news outlets, which yielded up to 81% precision, 58% recall and 62% F-measure on different data sets. In addition, we also report results of all three variants of the recall-oriented understudy for gisting evaluation (ROUGE) software, a tool which compares and scores automatically generated summaries against standard summaries.},

  abstract={The breach of privacy in encrypted instant messenger (IM) service is a serious threat to user anonymity. Performance of previous de-anonymization strategies was limited to 65%. We perform network de-anonymization by taking advantage of the cause-effect relationship between sent and received packet streams and demonstrate this approach on a data set of Yahoo! IM service traffic traces. An investigation of various measures of causality shows that IM networks can be breached with a hit rate of 99%. A KCI Causality based approach alone can provide a true positive rate of about 97%. Individual performances of Granger, Zhang and IGCI causality are limited owing to the very low SNR of packet traces and variable network delays.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we study the time evolution of academic collaboration networks by predicting the appearance of new links between authors. The accurate prediction of new collaborations between members of a collaboration network can help accelerate the realization of new synergies, foster innovation, and raise productivity. For this study, the authors collected a large data set of publications from 630 conferences of the IEEE and ACM of more than 257, 000 authors, 61, 000 papers, capturing more than 818, 000 collaborations spanning a period of 10 years. The data set is rich in semantic data that allows exploration of many features that were not considered in previous approaches. We considered a comprehensive set of 98 features, and after processing identified eight features as significant. Most significantly, we identified two new features as most significant predictors of future collaborations; 1) the number of common title words, and 2) number of common references in two authors’ papers. The link prediction problem is formulated as a binary classification problem, and three different supervised learning algorithms are evaluated, i.e. Na¨ıve Bayes, C4.5 decision tree and Support Vector Machines. Extensive efforts are made to ensure complete spatial isolation of information used in training and test instances, which to the authors’ best knowledge is unprecedented. Results were validated using a modified form of the classic 10-fold cross validation (the change was necessitated by the way training, and test instances were separated). The Support Vector Machine classifier performed the best among tested approaches, and correctly classified on average more than 80% of test instances and had a receiver operating curve (ROC) area of greater than 0.80.},

  title        = {Capacity {A}nalysis of {C}ombined {IPTV} and {V}o{IP} over {IEEE} 802.11n},
  abstract     = {Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) have gained unprecedented growth rates in the past few years. Data rate and high coverage area of IEEE 802.11n motivate the concept of combined IPTV and VoIP over IEEE 802.11n. Transmission of combined IPTV and VoIP over a wireless network is a challenging task. In this paper, we deal with the capacity evaluation of combined IPTV and VoIP over IEEE 802.11n. We evaluate the use of Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) at transport layer of IPTV and VoIP. Our study shows that DCCP can enhance capacity of IPTV by 25%. Our study confirms that performance of DCCP deteriorates severely in presence of any other UDP flow because of congestion-less mechanism of UDP. Our fairness analysis with TCP traffic shows that IPTV and VoIP using DCCP provides fair share in bandwidth to TCP with 19% increase in combined capacity. We study the effect of IEEE 802.11n parameters and obtain optimal values. We show the optimal values and trends of Access Point (AP) parameters including Queue size, Transmission Opportunity, Aggregation and Block ACK etc. Our study shows that nearly 9 more VoIP users are supported with a queue size of 70 packets and transmission opportunity of 9. Our study concludes that selection of DCCP and optimized parameters over IEEE 802.11n can enhance the capacity of IPTV and VoIP by atleast 25% and 19% respectively as compared to the use of UDP.},

  abstract     = {Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) has gained an enormous growth rate by revolutionizing personal entertainment. High data rates with increased coverage radius of IEEE 802.11n Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) motivate the concept of wireless IPTV. Streaming of Television contents over highly pervasive wireless environment with satisfactory Quality of Service (QoS) is a challenging task. Focusing on wireless IPTV, our work deals with the capacity evaluation of IPTV users over IEEE 802.11n. We first present an upper capacity limit for supporting maximum number of users over IEEE 802.11n. We then propose that 4-times packet size is the optimal frame aggregation size for IPTV which maximizes users capacity and QoS. Finally, we suggest the use of Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) at transport layer for IPTV. We show that DCCP capacity for IPTV increases upto 35% by reducing packet losses at Access Point (AP), compared to User Datagram Protocol (UDP). We further evaluate fairness of IPTV traffic in the presence of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) traffic in the network. Our study concludes that IPTV using DCCP over IEEE 802.11n not only provides increased user's capacity but also co-exists fairly with TCP traffic.},
