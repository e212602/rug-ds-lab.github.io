  abstract  = "This paper investigates how to complement Complex Event Processing (CEP) with dynamic quality monitoring mechanisms and support the dynamic integration of suitable sensory data sources. In the proposed approach, queries to detect complex events are annotated with consumer-definable quality policies that are evaluated and used to autonomously assign (or even configure) suitable data sources of the sensing infrastructure. We present and study different forms of expressing quality policies and explore how they affect the process of quality monitoring including different modes of assessing and applying quality-related adaptations. A performance study in an IoT scenario shows that the proposed mechanisms in supporting quality policy monitoring and adaptively selecting suitable data sources succeed in enhancing the acquired quality of results while fulfilling consumers' quality requirements. We show that the quality-based selection of sensor sources also extends the network's lifetime by optimizing the data sources' energy consumption.",

  title = "AQuA-CEP: Adaptive Quality-Aware Complex Event Processing in the Internet of Things",
  abstract = "Sensory data profoundly influences the quality of detected events in a distributed complex event processing system (DCEP). Since each sensor’s status is unstable at runtime, a single sensing assignment is often insufficient to fulfill the consumer’s quality requirements. In this paper, we study in the context of AQuA-CEP the problem of dynamic quality monitoring and adaptation of complex event processing by active integration of suitable data sources. To support this, in AQuA-CEP, queries to detect complex events are supplemented with consumer-definable quality policies that are evaluated and used to autonomously select (or even configure) suitable data sources of the sensing infrastructure. In addition, we studied different forms of expressing quality policies and analyzed how it affects the quality monitoring process. Various modes of evaluating and applying quality-related adaptations and their impacts on correlation efficiency are addressed, too. We assessed the performance of AQuA-CEP in IoT scenarios by utilizing the notion of the quality policy alongside the query processing adaptation using knowledge derived from quality monitoring. The results show that AQuA-CEP can improve the performance of DCEP systems in terms of the quality of results while fulfilling the consumer’s quality requirements. Quality-based adaptation can also increase the network’s lifetime by optimizing the sensor’s energy consumption due to efficient data source selection.",

	abstract = "In event processing systems, detected event patterns can reveal privacy-sensitive information. In this paper, we propose
and discuss how to integrate pattern-level privacy protection in event-based systems. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, we aim to enforce privacy independent of the particularities of specific operators. We accomplish this by supporting the flexible integration of multiple obfuscation techniques and studying deployment strategies for privacy-enforcing mechanisms. Moreover, we share ideas on how to model the adversary’s knowledge to better select appropriate obfuscation techniques for the discussed deployment strategies. Initial results indicate that flexibly choosing obfuscation techniques and deployment strategies is essential to conceal privacy-sensitive event patterns accurately.",
