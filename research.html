<p>Distributed Information Systems are concerned with the delocalization of computation on several hosts and their
    coordination via message passing. Looking at today's information systems, one notices that most of them, if not all,
    have some form of distribution. The key issues that emerge for research become those of addressing heterogeneity,
    scalability, and run-time adaptation. 
</p>

<p>In the context of distributed systems, the group focuses on a number of sub-areas: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Service-Oriented and Cloud Computing</li>
    <li>Pervasive Computing</li>
    <li>Middleware for Pervasive Computing and Adaptive Communications</li>
    <li>Network-centric Real-time Analytics, and</li>
    <li>Sensor Networks</li>
</ul>

<p>While interesting applications areas for the group are</p>
<ul class="pb-3">
    <li>Healthcare</li>
    <li>Domitcs</li>
    <li>Smart Energy Systems</li>
</ul>
