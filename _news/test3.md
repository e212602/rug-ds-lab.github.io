The rise of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has introduced new challenges in data security and latency. Researchers from the university's Distributed Systems department have developed an edge computing framework that enhances both performance and security for IoT networks.

Dubbed "EdgeGuard", the system uses a combination of lightweight encryption, decentralized trust management, and predictive caching to minimize vulnerabilities in IoT networks. It ensures that sensitive data remains secure at the network's edge, reducing the risks associated with centralized cloud processing.

“Our framework not only improves data security but also speeds up real-time processing,” said lead researcher Dr. Laila Chen. “By shifting computation closer to the source, we reduce dependence on cloud infrastructure, leading to a 40% improvement in response times for IoT applications.”

EdgeGuard has been tested in smart city environments, where real-time decision-making is crucial. In pilot projects monitoring traffic congestion and environmental conditions, the system outperformed existing cloud-based solutions by handling local data processing up to 50% faster.

The research team is now partnering with IoT device manufacturers to explore real-world deployment opportunities. With the continued expansion of edge computing, EdgeGuard could become a critical component in securing next-generation smart technologies.
