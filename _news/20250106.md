The CogniGron Research Center and the Distributed Systems Research Groups of TU Ilmenau and University of Groningen organized a workshop on January 6, 2025 to discuss research findings, initiatives, and challenges for Sustainability in Distributed and Networked Systems.

Researchers from the University of Groningen, TU Ilmenau, and TU Darmstadt met to exchange on initiatives like the CogniGron research center, the Ilmenau School of Green electronics, the collaborative research center MAKI, and a new project on green business process management. Furthermore, the workshop enabled in the form of excellent presentations of young researchers to exchange research findings towards sustainability in distributed and networked systems by taking the hardware and software perspectives. A particular highlight of the workshop was the dissertation talk of Saad Saleh on ``Methods and Design for Analog Computing Architectures: Memristors for Enhancing Expressiveness and Energy-Efficiency of Packet Processors.''
