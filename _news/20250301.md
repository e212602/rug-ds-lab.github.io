Our member Dilek Dustegor's research was recently featured in an article series on water research by the Faculty of Science and Engineering - University of Groningen.

In times of climate change, rethinking our approach to water is more important than ever. Dilek's research, recently featured in an article series on water research by Faculty of Science and Engineering - University of Groningen, looks at how we can minimize rainwater overflow in cities and reduce its uncontrolled discharge into nature. This ties directly into her project DDTClean, funded by NWO (Dutch Research Council), where she is developing intelligent wastewater governance solutions.
